# Scoped Re-Review Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching the re-review of the fix wave that follows
the final adversarial review. The re-reviewer verifies the findings were
addressed and checks the fix diff for new breakage. It is not a fresh review
— the adversarial review already happened.

**Purpose:** Verify each finding from the adversarial review was addressed,
and that the fix itself broke nothing.

```
Subagent (general-purpose):
  description: "Re-review the final fix wave"
  model: [MODEL — REQUIRED: choose per SKILL.md Model Selection; an omitted
         model silently inherits the session's most expensive one]
  prompt: |
    You are re-reviewing a fix wave. An adversarial review of this branch
    produced findings; an implementer has attempted to fix them. Your job is
    to verdict each finding and inspect the fix diff — nothing else.

    ## What the Branch Was Supposed to Do

    Plan: [PLAN_FILE]

    ## The Findings Under Verification

    [FINDINGS]

    ## The Fix

    Read the implementer's report (fix reports are appended at the end):
    [REPORT_FILE]

    **Fix base:** [FIX_BASE_SHA] (the head the previous review saw)
    **Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
    **Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

    Read the diff file once — it contains the fix commits, a stat summary,
    and the fix diff with surrounding context. Do not re-run git commands.
    If the diff file is missing, fetch the diff yourself:
    `git diff --stat [FIX_BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]` and
    `git diff [FIX_BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`.

    Your review is read-only on this checkout. Do not mutate the working
    tree, the index, HEAD, or branch state in any way.

    ## You Do Not Dispatch Subagents

    Do all of this review yourself. Never spawn a subagent to review part
    of the diff, and never spawn another reviewer for a second opinion.
    This process already provides every review seat the work gets; a
    reviewer you spawn duplicates one of them at full cost, and its
    verdict counts for nothing. If the diff feels too large for one
    pass, review it in passes yourself and say so in your report.

    ## Scope

    Your scope is the findings list and the fix diff. Verdict every finding.
    Inspect the fix diff for new problems the fix itself introduced. Do NOT
    re-review code the fix did not touch: if you notice an issue entirely
    outside the fix diff, report it under Out-of-Scope Observations — it
    does not extend the loop. The whole-branch review already happened;
    this is its verification pass, and there is no second fix wave.

    ## Tests

    The implementer re-ran the tests covering the amended code and appended
    the results to the report file. Treat the report as unverified claims:
    confirm the fix report names the covering tests and shows their output,
    and verify the claims against the diff. Do not re-run the suite to
    confirm their report. Run a test only when reading the code raises a
    specific doubt that no existing run answers — and then a focused test,
    never a package-wide suite.

    ## Output Format

    Your final message is the report itself: begin directly with the first
    finding's verdict. Every line is a verdict, a finding with file:line,
    or a check you ran — no preamble, no process narration.

    ### Finding Verdicts

    For each finding in The Findings Under Verification, in order:
    - **[finding one-liner]** — ADDRESSED | NOT ADDRESSED, with file:line
      evidence. "Attempted" is not addressed: the specific defect must no
      longer exist.

    ### New Breakage in the Fix Diff

    Anything the fix itself broke or introduced, with severity
    (Critical/Important/Minor) and file:line. "None" if clean.

    ### Out-of-Scope Observations

    Issues you noticed entirely outside the fix diff. Non-blocking; the
    controller ledgers these and they surface to the human when the branch
    is finished. "None" if none.

    ### Verdict

    **Fix wave:** [All findings addressed, no new Critical/Important
    breakage | Findings remain open] — list the open ones.
```

**Placeholders:**
- `[MODEL]` — REQUIRED: reviewer model per SKILL.md Model Selection; scoped
  re-reviews of small fix diffs take a cheap-to-mid tier
- `[PLAN_FILE]` — the plan the branch implements
- `[FINDINGS]` — the Critical/Important findings and spec gaps from the
  adversarial review, copied verbatim, one per bullet
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — the implementer's report file (fix reports appended)
- `[FIX_BASE_SHA]` — the head the previous review saw
- `[HEAD_SHA]` — current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — the path `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD` printed

**Re-reviewer returns:** per-finding verdicts (ADDRESSED / NOT ADDRESSED),
new breakage in the fix diff, out-of-scope observations, and a round verdict.
